### logbook
My own react project for developping a pilot logbook. Work in progress...

# Intro
I want to build this pilot logbook app out of personal interest. I've taken Jonas Schmedtmann's courses on Udemy and so far it's been great! Always a bunch of challenges in coding though, so I figured I need to start practicing with my own project. This was also suggested by Jonas after the first part of the React course. So I begin my medium-term project now, knowing all too well that it will evoled.

## What's in it
I've used React component to build a basic layout. Very basic SCSS for now. The layout lets you ADD a flight, but that is the only interactive option for now. 

## What I see in the future
This app will ideally include the following features:
- Full edit of logbook entries
- Aircraft (registrations) flown list (IOT quick pick during logbook entry)
- MongoDB backend to turn this into a cloud-based app (took the NodeJS course and loved it!)
- and more...
